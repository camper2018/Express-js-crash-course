Express is a fast, un opinionated ie. no file structure or design pattern imposed unlike 'laravel' for php, 'django' for python, and minimalist web framework for Node.js.
Express is a server-side or back-end framework.
Makes building web applications with Node.js much easier.
Used for both server rendered apps (serving HTML pages pr pages built with pub or ejs or handlebar template engines) as well as API/Microservices.
Extremely light, fast and free
Full control of request and responses
By far the most popular Node framework.

Middleware: Are the functions that have access to the request and response object.
Express has built in middleware but we can also use 3d party packages as well as custom middlewares.
Uses:
Execute any code
make changes to the request/ response objects
End response cycle
